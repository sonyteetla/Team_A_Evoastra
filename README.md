# Team_A_Evoastra
A Python-based web scraping and data analysis project that extracts, analyzes, and visualizes remote job market trends from RemoteOK using Selenium and data visualization techniques.


📊 Remote Job Market Analysis using Web Scraping

This project focuses on analyzing remote job market trends by scraping job postings from the RemoteOK website. Since the platform loads content dynamically and uses Cloudflare protection, Selenium is used to simulate real browser behavior and extract job data ethically and reliably.

The scraped data is cleaned, processed, and stored in CSV format. Various analyses are performed to identify trends based on job categories, job types, locations, skills, and posting frequency over time. Data visualization techniques are used to present insights through bar charts, pie charts, and line graphs.

The project demonstrates the practical application of web scraping, data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and visualization to derive meaningful insights from real-world job market data.
